Hi, I'm Claire! I'm a composer based in Hobart, Tasmania. 

I'm half way through my bachelor degree in classical music composition and I'm passionate about sharing my music with a broader audience - so I've made a website! Stay tuned for udates on new projects, performances and recordings of my work. 

If you're interested in collaborating with me on a new project, please don't hesitate to contact me (see the 'About' section for more details).
